# TinyReact
Tiny React is a lightweight clone of the popular JavaScript library, React. This project aims to provide a simplified yet educational implementation of React's core concepts, focusing on the key aspects of JSX processing, rendering, efficient patching, and component lifecycle.
An educational project designed to help me understand the inner workings of React by building a simplified version from scratch. This taught me how JSX blocks are processed into a lightweight Virtual DOM (VDOM), how the VDOM is transformed into the regular DOM, the importance of the "key" property for efficient patching, and the creation, lifecycle, and rendering procedures of React components.
